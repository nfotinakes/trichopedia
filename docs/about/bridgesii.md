## Description
---
T. Bridgesii has a light green epidermis and usually has between 4 and 8 ribs. Spines range in coloration and can be from honey-colored to brown, usually in groups of around 4. Spines can vary in length, usually longer than pachanois but can vary. Areoles are often spaced further apart than T. Pachanoi.

## Taxonomy
---
T. Bridgesii has been renamed to Echniopsis lageniformis (as Echniopsis Bridgesii already referred to another species). Within the hobby most still refer to it as T. Bridgesii, and this site will use that classification.
