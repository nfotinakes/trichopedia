## Description
---
T. pachanoi usually has 6 to 8 rounded ribs but is known to have down to 4 or up to 10. The ribs usually are shallow in-between but can become more pronounced when dehydrated. The areoles are often white/tan with a fuzzy appearance and a distinct notch above it, sometimes referred to as a "seagull" or "eyebrow." Spines on T. pachanoi are usually small (2-5mm), with approximately 6 spines per areole, are yellowish in color, and typically point upwards. The color is usually a hue of green, from dark forest to slightly blue. T. pachanoi produces large white flowers that bloom at night, lasting only a short time. When mature, it will produce "pups" or branches emerging from an areole, usually near the base of the plant (basal pup).

## Taxonomy
---
There is debate around the taxonomy of Trichocereus pachanoi. On wikipedia, it is classified as Trichocereus macrogonus var pachanoi. Sometimes it is cited as being the genus "Echinopsis" as well. In the hobby, you will usually see it still referred to as T. pachanoi, and this site will use that classification.
