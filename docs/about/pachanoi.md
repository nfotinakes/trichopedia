[Trichocereus Pachanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichocereus_macrogonus_var._pachanoi) is the primary species of cactus that is referred to under the umbrella of "San Pedro." T pachanoi is native to the Andes at an elevation of (6,600-9,800ft) altitude within Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia.

## Description
---
T. Pachanoi usually has 6 to 8 rounded ribs but is known to have down to 4 or up to 10. The ribs usually are shallow in-between but can become more pronounced when dehydrated. The areoles are often white/tan with a fuzzy appearance and a distinct notch above it, sometimes referred to as a "seagull" or "eyebrow." Spines on T. Pachanoi are usually small (2-5mm), with approximately 6 spines per areole, are yellowish in color, and typically point upwards. The color is usually a hue of green, from dark forest to slightly blue. T. Pachanoi produces large white flowers that bloom at night, lasting only a short time. When mature, it will produce "pups" or branches emerging from an areole, usually near the base of the plant (basal pup).

## Taxonomy
---
There is much debate around the taxonomy of Trichocereus Pachanoi. Officially, it is classified as a variety under the species "macrogonus" as Trichocereus macrogonus var pachanoi. It is also rumored to be changed to the genus "Echinopsis" as well. In the hobby, you will usually see it still referred to as Trichocereus, and this site will use that classification.
