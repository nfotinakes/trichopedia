Psycho0, pronounced Psycho-Naught, is a bridgesii clone. According to Facebook user Hubert F Alberquerqe who was one of the original growers to source the clone: 

"I named it after Aaron, a friend of mine on the sab corroboree forum who passed away-his forum name was Psycho0, with the backing of the forum. As there was a lot of this cultivar going around and i felt
It needed a clone name. Pretty sure it came from cactus country, Damian ward could confirm. So many moons ago. My row of Psycho0 is at least 7 metres high."

Damian added the clone was originally to be called "Bluey" before being named Psycho0.


## Characteristics

Facebook user Mark Hoffman states: 

"Pretty typical growth for psycho0. It (like many bridges) throws out seemingly randomly arranged sets of spines, which can grow 6+ inches long on lower sections, then goes spineless up top. It gets fat. I put a tape measure around one of these and it was 13 inches circumference.
It's one of the best plants to breed with, it's offspring in both maternal and paternal crosses are usually pretty interesting, with long, brightly colored spines."
