Huarazensis is a pachanoi clone from Peru. The following is from [Trichocereus.net](https://trichocereus.net/trichocereus-huarazensis-echinopsis-huarazensis/?fbclid=IwAR1jPrjc7EmnsF00UrOZHaRQTizYgHRnJ1U_laicoK7qDjd7Jmomxntgx3Q):  

"Trichocereus huarazensis is a columnar cactus from Huaraz in Peru. It is not an official species and it is a commercial variety of Trichocereus pachanoi that goes back to Karel Knize. Knize sold seeds and plants from a wild population in Huaraz. A Trichocereus grower in the United States obtained a cutting from Mr. Knize, which was the start for this rare clone in the Trichocereus community. Today, Trichocereus huarazensis is used in many different hybrid crosses of the US breeder Misplant, and it was also used by crosses of the US breeder Nitrogen.
There is also a wild collection of Trichocereus seeds from Huaraz that was collected by Chavin Herbalists. The collection is called Huarazino and it is probably from the same plants that Karel Knize collected his seeds from too."
