Growing trichocereus from seed is a rewarding way of propagating new trichocereus plants. As all species of trichocereus are self-sterile, the only way for a plant to produce seeds, is to cross-polinate with another genetically diverse plant.  

There are many different "teks" or guides to growing trichocereus from seed, but they all follow the same basic ideas. Here we will walk you through the basic overview while linking to some of the different teks if you want to choose to follow one more specific.

## What You Will Need
<hr>

First you will need to gather some basic things to get started.

### Seeds

Obviously, you will need some trichocereus seeds.  

When shopping for seeds, you may notice a format to the names. As we know, trichocereus must cross pollinate with another plant, so the seed names will be labeled as "Plant 1 x Plant 2" where Plant 1 is the mother plant and Plant 2 is the father plant. Sometimes seeds will be labeled with only one name or with the suffix "OP" after it, which means the mother plant was "open pollinated" by another unknown trichocereus plant.

Here are some to get you started:

* [Misplant](https://www.misplant.net) - A legendary trichocereus breeder with great genetics. Only accepts mail-order forms and cash/check. Make sure to follow all instructions as listed on site.
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanpedrocactusforsale) - A subreddit that sources many clones and seeds as well. Be sure to check flair for trusted vendors.
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheTrichocereusCommunity/) - This one of many trichocereus related Facebook groups that discusses ornamental growing of trichocereus. Full of great information. Seeds can often be found.

### Soil

You will need to prepare a well draining soil mixture for you seeds. For the most part, any organic potting soil mixed 50/50 with some type of inorganic drainage will do. 

Many recommend FoxFarm soils:

* [Ocean Forest](https://foxfarm.com/product/ocean-forest-potting-soil/)
* [Happy Frog](https://foxfarm.com/product/happy-frog-potting-soil/)

But any bagged potting mix or cactus/succulent soil will work.

Then get yourself either a bag of [Pumice](https://cactusjungle.com/product/uni-gro-4qt-pumice/?attribute_pa_size=4-quart&srsltid=AfmBOoqp1L3vJat-9hJtGeDXPgF0nC_FavEG72Yp7GeDwQBg-AhCTyDtebY) or [Perlite](sBhCEARIsAOVwHuRr2FETI_5rxgq8XC4krlzMnm_Y88V5nZq5d8VRj_nuY1pl6IWXYu8aAlBrEALw_wcB). These are the two most common drainage additives and while some perfer one over the other, either will work. Often one is more available than the other in your area, so you may have to shop around unless you ship it which can be expensive.

To prepare your mix, simply mix one part of your soil to one part pumice/perlite to make a 50/50 blend.

    * Note: some growers will tell you to sterlize your soil medium to kill any 
    nasty microbes that may be in the soil. Many will say to microwave your mix,
    but I find this unnecessary and it is important to note that microwaving is
    not true sterilization.

### Container

You need some sort of pot or container to plant your seeds in.
