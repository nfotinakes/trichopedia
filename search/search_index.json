I planted and grew them for several years, wintering them over inside and moving them back out in the spring. I lived in Washington at the time and it was too cold and wet in the winter to leave them out. Several years later- my interest peaked and I did more research and learned that they were pc, and not very desirable. I then ordered some bridgesii cuttings from another member, but still cherished my pc as they had been with me through some crazy times in my life. At one point I decided to pick up some fabric pots as I figured they'd be great for cacti, and had repotted one of my pc, and had it behind my house near the ally for best sun. That very day, someone stole it! I was obviously quite upset about it. I had vented on the Nexus about it to some of my fellow cactus growers and was ready to move on.    A couple days later, I got a message from a member who I barely knew, who told me he wanted to replace my cactus that was stolen with a VERY desirable true pachanoi. I was so happy! We became very good long distance friends over the next year or two, gifting each other nice things we had come across. I was getting more into the cacti, and also had some major personal changes going on in my life, and decided to relocate to California for a number of reasons, one of them being that I had the opportunity to create my dream garden in my father's yard.    Upon arriving in California, my friend who also lived in California told me he had some housewarming gifts for me and that I should come visit him. He basically completely filled up the back of my pickup truck with desirable trichocereus, much of it being the very desirable true pachanoi that he had gifted me when I lived in Washington. He even took me to visit some mother plants. I was very fond of this pachanoi, and since it grew near a landfill, we started calling it the landfill cactus, or just Landfill. I started talking about it in various groups, and sending out cuttings to cool members, and also trading it.    Eventually other folks caught on to how special it is and it started to generate a lot of buzz within the community. It became so sought after that it started fetching crazy prices in auctions, and started actually causing bad feelings between people. Apparently, the mother plant is now gone. I suspect it was raped and removed by someone out of greed, but I really don't know, and haven't seen it with my own eyes.
